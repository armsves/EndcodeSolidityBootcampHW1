Encode Solidity Bootcamp 7pm Homework 1
This is the interaction with the contract on Sepolia Testnet
0x5c3B43EBc9358072B3227B56866449DD618ad7Ef
is the contract id
I transferred ownership back and forth with 2 different wallets you can see on etherscan
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5c3B43EBc9358072B3227B56866449DD618ad7Ef

I also improved the contract adding another verification so the new owner can't be the same as the current owner
